        This document introduces the use cases and requirements of a client, edge, and cloud coordination mechanism and its standardization.

        <p>
        This is still a work in progress. The proposal is being incubated in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-networks/">W3C Web & Networks Interest Group</a>.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>With the rapid development of cloud computing technology, the centralized cloud is evolving towards a distributed "edge cloud".  An edge cloud allows developers to deploy their code using function-as-a-service (FaaS) close to the user's location. One such service is Alibaba Cloud's <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/dynamic-route-for-cdn/latest/er-overview">EdgeRoutine</a> 
          service.</p>
      
        <p>
          With the rapid adoption of new technologies such as machine learning, IoT etc. in client side applications, client side applications may also need to perform computing intensive work. For example, machine
          learning inference can also be done in the client side. As one such example, the Taobao mobile App leverages client side machine learning inference for user face detection etc.
          W3C is also working on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webmachinelearning">WebNN</a> standard that allows client side developers to leverage the machine learning acceleration
          hardware that resides in client side devices.
        </p>

        <p>
          To improve the client side application's performance, there is a trend to offload computing intensive work to the edge cloud, including such approaches as cloud apps, cloud gaming etc.
          However, the current approach could be further optimized if there existed a mechanism for Client-Edge-Cloud coordination.
          This document discusses the use cases and requirements of a Client-Edge-Cloud coordination mechanism and its standardization.

      <h2>Stakeholders and Business Models</h2>
      <p>Different stakeholders with an interest in edge computing will have different
      motivations and priorities.  In this section we present a categorization of the different
      kinds of stakeholders and their business models.  As we present use cases and discuss
      proposals we can then relate these to the motivating drivers of different stakeholders.

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>

      <p>
        Client side applications can be generally classified into the following categories:
      </p>
      <dl>
          <dt>Render intensive application:</dt><dd>
              <p>
                Render intensive applications are client side applications whose main task is to fetch content from the backend server then render that content in the front-end.
                For example, news, social media Web applications, and mobile applications belongs to this category.
              </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Computing intensive application:</dt><dd>
              <p>
                Computing intensive applications are client side applications whose main task is to do computing intensive work on the client. For example, mobile gaming applications 
                need to calculate certain objects' locations and other complex parameters based on user interaction then render in the client side. 
              </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Hybrid application:</dt><dd>
              <p>
                Hybrid applications are applications whose main task includes both rendering intensive work and computing intensive work. For example, modern e-commerce mobile applications 
                leverage machine learning inference in the client side for AR/VR type user experiences. At the same time, e-commerce mobile applications need to fetch dynamic content based
                on user preferences.
              </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Mobile/static client:</dt><dd>
            <p>
              Some client side applications remain static most of the time. For example, a camera for traffic monitoring and analysis does not require mobility support. 
              On the other hand, some client side applications will change location continuously. For example, applications running on a connected vehicle or self driving vehicle 
              will change location rapidly with the vehicle.
            </p>
        </dd>
       </dl>


      <p>
        The use cases in the following sections are generally classified into the following categories based on the different work load type:
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Accelerated work loads</h3>
          <p>
            For this category of use cases, the client side application leverages the edge cloud for accelerating certain work loads by offloading those work loads to the edge.
          </p>
          <section id="UC-CA">
            <h4>Cloud App (UC-CA)</h4>
                <p>
                  A Cloud App is a new form of application which utilizes cloud computing technology to move a client side application's work load to the Edge Cloud and/or a Central Cloud. The user interaction happens 
                  at the client device side and the computing and rendering process happens in the Edge Cloud side. This can accelerate the client side application's performance, lower the client's hardware requirements, and reduce cost.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  As one example of a cloud App, Alibaba Group's Tmall Genie smart speaker leverages the Edge Cloud to offload its computing intensive and accelerated work load from the client side to the Edge Cloud.
                </p> 
      
                <p>
                  The client, the Central Cloud, and the Edge Cloud work together in a coordinated way for Cloud Apps. Typically, the control and orchestration function is located in the Central Cloud.
                  The computing intensive function is located in the Edge Cloud. The user interaction and display function is located in the client.
                </p>

                </figure> 
          </section>

          <section id="UC-VR">
            <h4>VR/AR Acceleration (UC-VR)</h4>
              <p>
                VR/AR devices such as VR/AR glasses normally have limited hardware resources, so it is preferred to offload computing intensive tasks to Edge Resources for acceleration. This
                reduces delay since the Edge Resource is deployed near the location of the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note: this could be generalized to "acceleration of low-latency tasks".  Some other examples might include 
                game physics simulation or CAD tools (in a business environment).  The latter might add confidentiality
                constraints (a business user may want to offload to on-premises computers).
                This pattern is for local communication to/from the client.
                See also "Streaming Acceleration", where the communication is in-line with an existing network
                connection.
              </p>
          </section>

          <section id="UC-CG">
            <h4>Cloud Gaming (UC-CG)</h4>
              <p>
                Cloud gaming is a game mode which leverages Cloud and/or Edge Resources. Under the operation mode of a cloud game, the games are running on the Cloud side, and the game images are compressed and transmitted to users by video stream through the network after rendering. 
                The cloud gaming user can receive the game video stream and can send control commands to the cloud to control the game.
              </p>

              <p>Taking a "Click-and-Play" scenario for example: since all the rendering and control commands are offloaded to an Edge Resource, the cloud game user doesn't need to install the game locally. The user can just click the game and then play with it smoothly. </p>

              <p>
              By offloading the gaming work load to the edge and making full use of the computing power and low-latency network, the cloud gaming can provide more smoother experience.
              </p>
          </section>



          <section id="UC-SA">
            <h4>Streaming Acceleration (UC-SA)</h4>
            <p>In the case of video acceleration, we may want to offload work to a location with better
              compute performance that is already on the network path.  Specifically, consider a low-performance
              client that wants to compress video or do background removal as part of a teleconference.
              It could connect over a local high-performance wireless network to a local edge computer (perhaps
              an enhanced ISP gateway box) that would then perform the video processing and forward the processed
              video to the network.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: this pattern is for communication "in-line" with an existing
              network connection.
              See also "VR/AR", where the communication is to/from the offload target.
            </p>

            <section id="UC-VC">
              <h5>Online Video Conference (UC-VC)</h5>
                <p>
                  One special case of streaming acceleration consists of online video conference applications. Suppose that an online video conference system provides a real-time translation and subtitles service. 
                  This will use AI/Machine learning technology and it is computing intensive. Also, the real time translation service is very delay sensitive. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The online video conference application could be installed on PC terminals or mobile terminals.
                  For PC terminals, there is enough computing resources and enough disk storage to allow the installation of online video conference application. In this case, the computing
                  intensive work could be done in the PC terminal and provides an ultra-low-latency user experience.
                </p>
  
                <p>
                  For mobile terminals, there is limited disk storage and limited computing capability, so it is not possible to run the computing intensive task on the mobile terminals. In this case,
                  the computing intensive task could be offloaded to the Edge, also providing a low-latency user experience.

                  It is preferred that in this use case the online video conference application can offload the computing intensive task according to the terminal capability and Edge Resources availability.
                  The online video conference service provider can provide consistent user experience on different terminals.

              <p>
                Machine learning inference can be done in the client side to reduce latency. W3C is working on <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webmachinelearning">WebNN</a>  standard that 
                allows client side developers to leverage the machine learning acceleration hardware that resides in the client side devices.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The client side devices may have different hardware capabilities. For example, some mobile phones have very limited hardware resource and do not have a GPU. 
                It is very difficult for this kind of client device to run machine learning code. 
    
                So in this scenario, it is preferred to offload machine learning code to the Edge Cloud. The user experience is greatly improved in this case.

                <p>
                  One special case of machine learning acceleration is image and video processing and understanding. For some mobile image/video processing applications, it is required to use machine learning 
                  algorithms for image/video analysis and processing. This normally needs an NPU (Neural Processing Unit) chipset on the terminals for better performance.
                  For terminals without an NPU chipset, it is preferred to offload the machine learning computing intensive work load to the Edge Cloud as this will provide a consistent user experience 
                  on different terminals.

                  <p>
                    Another special case and example of machine learning acceleration is professional web-based media production. 
                    Processing and rendering media is a complex task. For example, a video editing application needs to do image processing, video editing, audio editing, etc. 
                    So it has high performance requirements.

                  <p>
                    Professional web-based media production relies on web-based media editing tools heavily, and may include AI-based operators which can be used to do cutting, eiting, transcoding and publishing of videos to the cloud. 
                    Since the Edge Cloud has more powerful computing power and is close to user's location,  by offloading the expensive rendering process to the Edge, web appliations can render media more quickly 
                    and provide a better user experience.

              <p>
                For applications which offload some parts of its functionalities to the Edge Cloud, if the Edge Cloud is not available due to client mobility or other reasons,
                it is preferred that the functionalities could be handed over back to the client when necessary. More complex rules could be designed to improve the robustness of the application.

                  It is preferred to offload the license plate recognition computing intensive task to the Edge when the network connection is stable. If the network condition is not stable or broken, the offloaded computing
                  intensive task could move back to the terminals to guarantee the availability of the service.

        <h3>IoT workloads</h3>
          <p>
          In general, there are many opportunities for IoT devices 
          to offload work to another computer, since they are generally
          constrained in processing power, energy, or both.  
          Video processing however is of special interest because of its 
          high data and processing
          requirements and privacy constraints.
          In this case the offload source is not necessarily a browser
          or web application but the process may be indirectly managed by one,
          and the capabilities provided by the proposed standard (e.g. a 
          discoverable compute utility) can also be used directly by
          an IoT device.

                Consider a robot navigating in a home using Visual SLAM.  In this case the robot has limited
                performance due to cost and power constraints.  So it wishes to offload the video processing work
                to another computer.  However, the video is sensitive private data so the user would prefer that
                it does not leave the user's premises, and would like to offload the processing to an Edge Resource,
                which in this case may be an existing
                desktop computer or an enhanced gateway computer (e.g. provided by an ISP).  Latency may also be a concern (the robot needs the 
                results immediately to make navigation decisions, for example to avoid a wire or other obstacle
                on the floor).

            <h4>Child Monitor (UC-CM)</h4>
              <p>
                In this use case a smart camera is directed to inform a
                parent if children leave a designated area, for example
                a yard. This requires person detection, a video
                analytics service which is computationally intense and
                difficult to perform on a phone.  However, for privacy
                reasons, the parent does not want to stream video to the
                Cloud and perform processing there; instead they want to run
                the computation on an Edge Resource under their direct control.  In this case, the
                parent also wants to run the processing as a background
                task that executes even when the browser/web app that 
                invoked it is closed.

        <h3>Persistent workloads (UC-PW)</h3>
          <p>
            In some cases it may be desireable to start a task from a browser that continues to run even when the 
            browser application is not active.  This could be used to monitor a condition for example and send
            a notification when that condition is met.  As a sub-category of this use case, the offloaded task
            might be used to monitor IoT devices and instead of or in addition to sending a notification, it
            might be used for automation. 
            Such an offloaded task might also be used to execute long-running computational
            tasks such as machine learning or data indexing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Persistent tasks require a mechanism to manage their lifetime using expiry dates or explicit controls.
            In the case of applying this to IoT orchestration, there is also the issue of granting access rights
            to such offloaded tasks, for example access to a LAN, to specific IoT devices on that LAN, and to the 
            data they generate.

      <h2>Gap Analysis</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Common approaches for offloading</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, there are two common approaches for offloading. One is to send the code in the request from the client to the Edge Resource, the other is to have the Edge Resource fetch the codes from file repositories on the Edge and execute them. Both work fine, but both approaches also have some downsides.
        </p>
  
        <dl>
          <dt>Sending codes from client to edge</dt>
          <dd> 
          <p>In this approach, the client sends the local code to the Edge Resource which then executes the code on the Edge side. The downside is obvious: since more data is transferred in the request it may cause network latency. Handling more data will also put more strain on the resource-restricted end device. Meanwhile, some codes are sensitive, data security is also an big issue.  </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Fetching codes from file repositories and executing on edge</dt>
          <dd>
          <figure>
            <img alt="EdgeFetch" src="images/edge_fetching_codes.png" width="600">
            <figcaption>
              Fetching codes from file repositories
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
  
          <p>In this approach, the client leverages a user-defined offloading library to send proper parameters to the Edge Resource.  The Edge Resource will then fetch the specified code from repositories and then execute the code.</p>
  
          <p>The downside of this approach is that additional file repositories are needed and the developers have to upload the code to the repository and make sure the local and the Edge have the same version of the code. </p>

          <p>Meanwhile, since the offloading library plays an important role in offloading, developers need to create a robust offloading policy to discover and connect with Edge Resources, decide which parts of the code can be offloaded, and the time to offload. This will put more strain on the developer and affect the overall programming experience and the productivity.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
          
      </section>


      <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
              The two approaches discussed above are mostly similar. The main difference is the way code is sent to the edge. However, in addition to the downsides mentioned, some common issues or pain points are still remain and need to be addressed. 
          </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Discrepancies between the client runtime and the Edge runtime may cause failures, as well as the runtime differences between one Edge Resource and another. So a unified runtime needs to be considered. A WebAssembly runtime may be a good choice.</li>
                <li>Capabilities for discovering and connecting with Edge Resources are needed. </li>
                <li>Some parts of the code might be sensitive, and the developer might not want it to be sent over the internet. Capabilities for developers to configure which parts can be offloaded are needed.</li>
                <li>When certain condition are met, for example, if there is no Edge Resource in proximity to the user or the internet is lost, codes should be executed locally instead of offloaded. That is to say, the developer will need to know what might be offloaded to a server but does not need to decide or care about when it is offloaded. </li>
                <li>Security and privacy are important, so secure communication mechanisms are needed.</li>
              </ul>

          <p>
            There is no W3C standard currently available to address the above gaps. To achieve interoperability between different vendors, standardization is needed.

                Note: If an edge resource has a usage charge, for example, 
                a client may want to set quotas on offload, 
                and some applications may need more resources than others.
                This may also require a negotiation, 
                e.g. a workload may have minimum requirements,
                making offload mandatory on limited clients.
                This is partially about QoS as it relates to performance
                (making sure a minimum amount of resources is available)
                but is also about controlling charges (so a web app does
                not abuse the edge resources paid for by a client).

      <h2>Architecture Proposals</h2>
        <p>
          This document proposes some different possible architectures to address the needs identified above.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Seamless code sharing across client/edge/cloud</h3>
          <p>This architecture allows the client, Edge, and the Central Cloud to share a common code running environment which allows the 
          task running in either client, edge, cloud or both in a coordinated way. 
        </p>

          <p>
            The proposed high level architectures is shown in the following figure:
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img alt="ClientEdgeArchitecture" src="images/Client_Edge_Architecture_v3.png" width="1000">
            <figcaption>
              Proposed High Level Architecture
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            In this architecture, the code of the work load in the client side could be offloaded to the Edge Cloud and can also be handed over to Central Cloud and handed over back to client.
            The high-level procedure is as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>
            The client side application encapsulates offloaded work load code into an offloaded code module and loads the code module using specific APIs for the runtime environment.
            There may be different types of runtime environment, for example, WebAssembly or JavaScript runtimes.
            The offloaded work load will be written according to the specific runtime.
          </li>

          <li>
            The client's runtime dispatch policy module queries the dispatch policy from the Offload Management Module which is located in the Edge Cloud or the Central Cloud.
          </li>

          <li>
            The Offload Management Module sends a dispatch policy to the client side application.
          </li>

          <li>
            The client side runtime sends the offloaded code to the target Edge Cloud/Central Cloud according to the dispatch policy.
          </li>

          <li>
            The target Edge Cloud/Central Cloud executes the offloaded work load and returns the result to the client application.
          </li>

          <li>
            If offloading is not feasible in certain conditions, for example, if the network connection between the client and Edge Cloud is not stable or 
            there is no enough resources in the Edge Cloud, the offloaded work load should handover back to the client side to ensure the availability of the client application.
          </li>
          </ul>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Distributed Workers</h3>
        <p>The Web already has a set of standards for managing additional
        threads of computation managed by application 
        code loaded into the browser: Web and Service Workers.
        Workers already support a message-passing style of communication
        which would allow them to execute remotely.
        This architectural option proposes extending workers to support
        edge computing as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Compute Utility services would be made available on the
            network that could provide
            a capability to execute Worker payloads.
            For fallback purposes, the client itself would also offer
            a Compute Utility to support local execution when needed.
            It would also be possible for the origin (the server) to host a Compute
            Utility.  However, in general Compute Utilities could be
            hosted at other locations, including in desktops on the LAN,
            within a local cloud, or within edge infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>Application developers would continue to use existing
            APIs for Workers, but could optionally provide metadata about
            performance and memory requirements which could be used to
            select an appropriate execution target.
        </li>
        <li>Browsers would collect metadata about available Compute
            Utility services, including latency and performance, and
            would select an appropriate target for each Worker.
            The user would have controls in the browser to control
            this rule, including the ability to specify specific offload
            targets or to force local execution when appropriate.
            Note: the reason it is suggested that the browser makes 
            the decision and not the application is to prevent fingerprinting
            and associated privacy risks.
            Metadata about available Compute Utilities might otherwise
            be used to infer location. The proposed architecture hides
            this information by default from the application while
            still supporting intelligent selection of offload targets.
        </li>
        <li>Once a Compute Utility is selected, the browser would
            automatically (transparent to the application) use the 
            network API of the Compute Utility to load and execute the
            workload for the Worker.  
            Note that in the existing Worker API, a URL of
            a JavaScript workload is provided to the Worker.  
        </li>
        <li>The Compute Utility itself would be responsible for downloading
            the workload, it would not have to be downloaded to the 
            browser and then uploaded.  Also, a WASM workload could be used,
            bootstrapping from the standard JavaScript workload.
            In general, the
            workload execution environment should be the same as the 
            normal Worker execution environment.  However, access to
            accelerators to support performance and other advanced capabilities
            will become more important in this context.
        </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The proposed high level architecture is shown in the following figure.
          The browser discovers Compute Utilities using 
          a Discovery mechanism. Discovery services in each discovered
          Compute Utility return metadata, which then allows the 
          selection of a Compute Utility for each workload.
          A Workload Management service is then
          used to load and run a packaged workload for the worker.

          <h2>Standardization Proposals</h2>
            <section>
              <h3>WebAssembly as unified runtime</h3>
                <p> This proposal proposes to extend WebAssembly runtime and use it in both client side and Edge Cloud side as a unified runtime.</p>
                <figure>

                    <p>
                      The client loads the WebAssembly code by invoking a standard API. This API should indicate that the WASM code could be offloaded to Edge cloud when certain condition is met.
                      This API should also set the destination Edge cloud's location identifier.
                    </p>

                  <dt>JavaScript API to specify workloads:</dt>
                    <dd>
                      This JavaScript API is to be used by a web application 
                      to specify a workload.
                      It indicates this workload may be offloaded to the 
                      edge cloud when certain conditions are meet.
                      The standardization of this API is required 
                      since different implementations should implement this API 
                      in the same way to make sure that the developers have the 
                      same user experience.

                      The workload should only be offloaded when certain conditions
                      are met. 
                      These condition may include Edge Cloud availability 
                      and network condition.

                <p>The following topics will be out of scope of standardization
                work:</p>

                    <dd>
                      This proposal recommends that the offloading policy is not 
                      standardized to allow flexible implementation by 
                      different vendors.

                <h3>Conclusion & Recommendations for the Way Forward</h3>

                <p>
                  As analyzed in the <a href="#gap"> gap analysis section</a> and in the <a href="#PotentialStandards">potential standards</a>  section, the proposed potential standards work is to specify a standardized 
                  common mechanism to offload code to the Edge Cloud. 
                  There may be multiple potential solutions and some of them may be related to <a href="https://www.w3.org/wasm/">WebAssembly</a> and some may be related to web platform APIs.
                </p>

                <p>There are basically two different approaches for the standardization:  </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Option 1: Divide the standardization work into different relevant W3C working groups. </li>
                  <li>Option 2: Establish a new working group that focus on the standardization of this problem.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  The disadvantage of option 1 is that if divided the work to different related working groups in W3C, it would be very difficult to maintain a unified architecture.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The advantage of option 2 is that it would be easier to maintain a unified architecture in one working group.
                  Considering this, it is preferred to establish a new working group (Option 2) to focus on the standardized solution development. The proposed new working group 
                  could develop the standard solution architecture firstly. If the standard solution architecture require extension of current W3C standards, the new working group could work together with related 
                  working groups (for example,<a href="https://www.w3.org/wasm/">WebAssembly Working Group</a> etc.) to develop the extensions. 
               </p>

               <p>
                 The proposed next step is to draft the charter which is used to establish the proposed new working group.
